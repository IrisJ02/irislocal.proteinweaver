# Contributing Guide

This is the guide for getting started with ProteinWeaver and will set you up to contribute to whichever aspects of ProteinWeaver interest you.

## Step 1: Fork & Installation

ProteinWeaver uses a Dockerized version of Neo4j as the database. [Follow these instructions](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) to install Docker Desktop.

We will also be using GitHub to contribute to ProteinWeaver. It is recommended to install [GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-authenticating-to-github-desktop/installing-github-desktop) because of its easy user interface.

Then you will need to [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) the [`contributing-guide`](https://github.com/Reed-CompBio/protein-weaver/tree/contributing-guide) branch of the ProteinWeaver GitHub repository to get the Zebrafish datasets and the base code for the front and backends in your own repository.

Once forked, clone the repository to your local desktop so that you have access to ProteinWeaver locally.

## Step 2: Data Import

The following section will be using a [`bash`](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)>) terminal to set up the Dockerized Neo4j environment. We highly reccomend looking through the Neo4j part of the Contributing guide doc in the GDrive and familiarising yourself with what is Neo4j, what are nodes and relationships, what the cypher query language is.

1. Open the Docker Desktop application.

2. Navigate to a terminal window and pull the official Neo4j Docker image with the following command:

```bash
docker pull neo4j:5.12.0-community-bullseye
```

3. Create a folder in your root directory named `neo4j`:

- Within the new `~/neo4j` directory create the following directories:
  - `~/neo4j/data/` to allow storage of database state between Docker instances
  - `~/neo4j/logs/` to allow storage of logs between Docker instances
  - `~/neo4j/import/` to store data for import
  - `~/neo4j/plugins/` to store any necessary plugins for production environments

4. Copy over all of the files in the cloned ProteinWeaver `/data/tutorial` directory to `~/neo4j/import/`.

5. Create a Neo4j Docker instance with GDS and APOC plugins using the following command:

```sh
docker run \
    --name proteinweaver \
    -p7474:7474 -p7687:7687 \
    -v $HOME/neo4j/data:/data \
    -v $HOME/neo4j/logs:/logs \
    -v $HOME/neo4j/import:/import \
    -v $HOME/neo4j/plugins:/plugins \
    --env NEO4J_AUTH=none \
    -e NEO4J_apoc_export_file_enabled=true \
    -e NEO4J_apoc_import_file_enabled=true \
    -e NEO4J_apoc_import_file_use__neo4j__config=true \
    -e NEO4J_PLUGINS='["graph-data-science"]' \
    -e NEO4JLABS_PLUGINS=\[\"apoc\"\] \
    neo4j:5.12.0-community-bullseye
```

- This docker instance has no security restrictions, to change username and password edit:
  `--env NEO4J_AUTH=username/password`

6. Access the docker image at [http://localhost:7474](http://localhost:7474) in your browser. You can ignore the username and password and just click connect.

7. If you ever need to rerun the docker instance, you can do `docker start -a proteinweaver`

### Toy Dataset

Before adding the zfish dataset it is recommended to play around with a toy dataset. This will get you a feel of what querying in neo4j is like. Write the following command in neo4j:

```
CREATE
  (alice:User {name: 'Alice', posts: 4, seed_label: 52}),
  (bridget:User {name: 'Bridget', posts: 13, seed_label: 21}),
  (charles:User {name: 'Charles', posts: 55, seed_label: 43}),
  (doug:User {name: 'Doug', posts: 5, seed_label: 21}),
  (mark:User {name: 'Mark', posts: 7, seed_label: 19}),
  (michael:User {name: 'Michael', posts: 15, seed_label: 52}),

  (alice)-[:FOLLOW {weight: 1}]->(bridget),
  (alice)-[:FOLLOW {weight: 10}]->(charles),
  (mark)-[:FOLLOW {weight: 1}]->(doug),
  (bridget)-[:FOLLOW {weight: 1}]->(michael),
  (doug)-[:FOLLOW {weight: 1}]->(mark),
  (michael)-[:FOLLOW {weight: 1}]->(alice),
  (alice)-[:FOLLOW {weight: 1}]->(michael),
  (bridget)-[:FOLLOW {weight: 1}]->(alice),
  (michael)-[:FOLLOW {weight: 1}]->(bridget),
  (charles)-[:FOLLOW {weight: 1}]->(doug)
```

Before moving on remove all of the newly created nodes with the following command: 

`MATCH (n) DETACH DELETE n;`

### Adding Z.Fish Data

1. Once in the Neo4j Browser, create constraints before data import. We use NCBI as the source of the unique taxon identifiers.
   `CREATE CONSTRAINT txid_constraint FOR (n:protein) REQUIRE (n.txid, n.id) IS UNIQUE;`
   Create a constraint for the GO terms in the database using the following command:
   `CREATE CONSTRAINT go_constraint FOR (n:go_term) REQUIRE n.id IS UNIQUE;`

2. Import _D. rerio_ [protein interactome](https://github.com/Reed-CompBio/protein-weaver/blob/database-tutorial/data/tutorial/zfish_interactome_Mar12_2024.txt) with the following command:

```js
:auto LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'file:///zfish_interactome_Mar12_2024.txt' AS zfish
FIELDTERMINATOR '\t'
CALL {
    with zfish
    MERGE (a:protein {id: zfish.uniprotID1, name: zfish.name1, txid: "txid7955", species: "Danio rerio"})
    MERGE (b:protein {id: zfish.uniprotID2, name: zfish.name2, txid: "txid7955", species: "Danio rerio"})
    MERGE (a)-[r:ProPro]-(b)
} IN TRANSACTIONS OF 100 ROWS;
```

3. Set a relationship property for the evidence

```js
:auto LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'file:///zfish_interactome_Mar12_2024.txt' AS zfish
FIELDTERMINATOR '\t'
CALL {
    with zfish
    MATCH (s:protein {id: zfish.uniprotID1, txid: "txid7955"})-[r:ProPro]-(t:protein {id: zfish.uniprotID2, txid: "txid7955"})
    SET r.evidence = zfish.evidence
} IN TRANSACTIONS OF 1000 ROWS;
```

4. Add [GO data](https://github.com/Reed-CompBio/protein-weaver/blob/database-tutorial/data/tutorial/zfish_GO_data_Mar12_24.tsv) to _D. rerio_ nodes:

```js
:auto LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'file:///zfish_GO_data_Mar12_24.tsv' AS zfishgo
FIELDTERMINATOR '\t'
CALL {
    with zfishgo
    MATCH (n:protein {id: zfishgo.GENE_PRODUCT_ID, txid: "txid7955"})
    MERGE (g:go_term {id: zfishgo.GO_TERM})
    MERGE (n)-[r:ProGo]-(g)
} IN TRANSACTIONS OF 1000 ROWS;
```

5. Set qualifier property for _D. rerio_.

```js
:auto LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'file:///zfish_GO_data_Mar12_24.tsv' AS zfishgo
FIELDTERMINATOR '\t'
CALL {
    with zfishgo
    MATCH (p:protein {id: zfishgo.GENE_PRODUCT_ID, txid: "txid7955"})-[r:ProGo]-(g:go_term {id: zfishgo.GO_TERM})
    SET r.relationship = zfishgo.QUALIFIER
} IN TRANSACTIONS OF 1000 ROWS;
```

6. The last step is calling a graph projection for pathfinding algorithms. We also have to change the ProPro edges to be undirected for the pathfinding algorithms in order to be more biologically accurate for protein-protein interaction networks.

```js
CALL gds.graph.project('proGoGraph',['go_term', 'protein'],['ProGo', 'ProPro']);
CALL gds.graph.relationships.toUndirected( 'proGoGraph', {relationshipType: 'ProPro', mutateRelationshipType: 'ProProUndirected'} ) YIELD inputRelationships, relationshipsWritten;
```

### Useful Commands:

If you make any mistakes use the following three commands to reset the state of the database.
1. Drop graph projection:
   `CALL gds.graph.drop('proGoGraph') YIELD graphName;`

2. Drop constraints:
   `DROP CONSTRAINT txid_constraint;`
   `DROP CONSTRAINT go_constraint;`

3. Delete nodes:
   `MATCH (n:protein {txid: 'txid7955'}) DETACH DELETE n;`

4. Show database information:
   `:schema`

Other useful commands:
1. Select a node:
    `MATCH (n:protein {name: "example"}) RETURN n`

2. Select a relationship:
    `MATCH (n:protein {name: "example"})-[r:ProGo]-(g:go_term) RETURN r`

3. Select a property:
    `MATCH (n:protein {name: "example"})-[r:ProGo]-(g:go_term) RETURN r.relationship`


## Step 3: Create a New Query in Neo4j

Now that you have imported the _D. rerio_ interaction network and annotations. It's time to explore the network and generate a new interesting query to you.

### First practice with some example commands:

1. Count how many nodes there are in the database:
   `MATCH (n) RETURN COUNT(n);`

2. Now count how many protein nodes there are:
   `MATCH (n:protein) RETURN COUNT(n);`

3. Return the first 25 nodes in the zebrafish txid:
   `MATCH (n:protein {txid: 'txid7955'}) RETURN n LIMIT 25;`

4. Retrieve all the species in the database:
   `MATCH (n:protein) RETURN COLLECT(DISTINCT n.species);`

5. Find nodes with a ProGo relationship (limit 25):
   `MATCH (p)-[r:ProGo]->(g) RETURN p, r, g LIMIT 25;`

6. Return the relationship qualifier property for the ProGo relationship (limit 25):
   `MATCH (p)-[r:ProGo]->(g) RETURN r.relationship LIMIT 25;`

7. Update property of existing node (for fun):
   `MATCH (n:protein {species: 'Danio rerio'}) SET n.species = 'Ranio derio';`

8. Set species property back to proper one:
   `MATCH (n:protein {species: 'Ranio derio'}) SET n.species = 'Danio rerio';`

9. Now it is your turn to devise a new Cypher query.

Your query should end in a RETURN statement rather than change a property. We highly recomend that your query return node(s). This will make the contributing guide smoother. We will use this query in the next step to create a new webpage that returns and presents the results of this query on ProteinWeaver's user interface. Here are some examples:

- What are top 10 proteins that have the highest degree number?
- What proteins have the most ProGo edges?
- What are the top 10 least annotated GO terms?

## Step 4: Setting up Local Development

Now that you have the Neo4j database up and running, and you have a query that you are interested in, we will now set up the frontend and backend for local development

### Backend Server

1. Open up a terminal window and go to the protein-weaver directory. Then go to the `/server` directory

2. We want to install npm which is responsible for building the necessary packages of the server. We will use a version manager for node, called nvm. This is helpful as it allows you to install multiple versions of node. More information about nvm can be found [here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). Follow the following commands in your terminal

```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash

export NVM_DIR="$([ -z "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME-}" ] && printf %s "${HOME}/.nvm" || printf %s "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/nvm")"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" # This loads nvm

nvm use

nvm install

npm install

npm start         # This starts our node.js server for our backend
```

3. If everything goes smoothly, you will get a message saying “Server listening on http://localhost:3000/”
4. If you also want to test that the API functionality is working, you can go to the following URL and it should say that you have successfully connected to the backend API: [http://localhost:3000/api/test](http://localhost:3000/api/test)

### Frontend

1. Open up another terminal window, and go to the client directory in the protein-weaver directory.
2. Do the following commands in the terminal window:

```
nvm use

npm install

npm run dev       # This will start our frontend instance
```

3. If everything goes smoothly, you should be greeted with a message from VITE, and that it is running on the local host of http://localhost:5173/

To summarize, we have set up neo4j and populated the database with D. rerio, created a query that we are interested in, and then set up the backend and frontend of protein-weaver for local development. The three localhost urls are found below

- Neo4j: [http://localhost:7474/browser/]()
- Backend: [http://localhost:3000/api/test]()
- Frontend: [http://localhost:5173/]()

## Step 5: Creating a New API Call

This section aims to create a new API call in the backend, utilizing the neo4j query you made previously.

### Understanding the Backend

Before we start implementing a new API call, it is important to have a better understanding of how the backend codebase looks like for proteinweaver. Refer to the videos to understand what the backend is in the ProteinWeaver's Contributing Guide Doc in the GDrive. We will go through the important files in the backend:

#### /src

Within the server directory, there is another folder called src, which contains important files that sets up the node.js server. You will generally never need to make changes within this folder. index.js is responsible for initializing node.js server, and also the neo4j driver that will be used to make the connection to the database. The neo4j.js file contains the driver. constants.js store variables including ports, url, and neo4j credentials.

#### .env

Within the server folder, we also have a file called .env which outlines the neo4j credentials we need.

#### /routes

The routes folder contains routes.js which houses all the API calls we use for proteinweaver. The router can take in multiple requests, including POST or GET requests. It is helpful to understand the general structure of setting up an API call, and we will use the example below. This API call is responsible for, given a list of nodes, provide us the average degree value.

```js
//Example of API call in routes.js

router.post("/getAvgDegree", jsonParser, async (req, res, next) => {
  const data = req.body;
  const nodeList = data.nodeList;
  const species = data.species;

  try {
    const avgDegreeService = new AvgDegreeService(getDriver());

    const avgDegree = await avgDegreeService.getAvgDegree(species, nodeList);
    console.log("Average Degree:");
    console.log(avgDegree);

    res.json(avgDegree);
  } catch (e) {
    next(e);
  }
});
```

We use the route.post() function to create a new POST API call. It takes in three parameters, first the API call’s URL, the parser we use, and the request, response and next variables. The req.body holds the information that the API caller has provided. This usually comes in the form of a JSON request body, and in this case this if the following body:

```
{"nodeList": ["Q6P2U7","Q6DHB6","Q1LXK0","Q502C6","F1QC03"],"species": "txid7955"}
```

The try-catch statement is used to capture potential errors and throw them in an appropriate manner. The try portion of the statement creates a new variable called avgDegreeService by using a class AvgDegreeService. This class is defined in a file called avg.degree.service.js in the service folder, and it is responsible for utilizing the neo4j driver, creating a query call with some parameters, and getting the response. The class contains the function getAvgDegree which takes in two parameters, species and nodeList. We use the await key because this is a type of Promise. This essentially tells the program to wait until we get the output from the avgDegreeService.getAvgDegree() function.

- Finally, we set the response in res.json to be the variable avgDegree

#### /services

The service folder contains the heart of all the dependent functions the routes.js file needs. This is where you will be adding a new neo4j query as a function that will then be called into a new route in routes.js. Before that, it is helpful to understand the general structure of what a service file is, and we will use avg.degree.service.js as an example.

```js
//avg.degree.service.js file

export default class AvgDegreeService {
  /**
   * @type {neo4j.Driver}
   */
  driver;

  /**
   * The constructor expects an instance of the Neo4j Driver, which will be
   * used to interact with Neo4j.
   *
   * @param {neo4j.Driver} driver
   */
  constructor(driver) {
    this.driver = driver;
  }

  async getAvgDegree(speciesInput, nodeList) {
    const session = this.driver.session();
    const res = await session.executeRead((tx) =>
      tx.run(
        `
          MATCH (p:protein {txid: $speciesInput})
          WHERE p.id IN toStringList($nodeList)
          WITH p
          MATCH (p)-[r:ProPro]-()
          WITH p, count(r) as degree
          RETURN avg(degree) as averageDegree;
          `,
        {
          speciesInput: speciesInput,
          nodeList: nodeList,
        }
      )
    );

    const deg = res.records;

    await session.close();

    return deg;
  }
}
```

This file creates a call called AvgDegreeService, and requires the neo4j driver we initialized in src/neo4j.js as a variable in the constructor. We create an async method (which is why we need the await keyword when we call the method) called getAvgDegree, which takes in the two parameters. You first have to initialize the neo4j driver session, and then we execute a read on the database with a neo4j query. Everything inside tx.run() is where you place the neo4j query. Notice that within the query, we use variables as the txid and the nodelist. These variables are paired in the portion after the neo4j query. Finally we close the neo4j session and return the res.records in a variable.

#### Testing API Calls

There are a number of ways to test our API calls. For this example, we will be testing out the `/getAvgDegree` API call using Google Chrome's developer feature (You can most likely try this with other browsers' developer tools). Do the following steps to test out the API call:

- Open up a Google Chrome tab and go to [https://example.com/](). For some reason testing API calls in the browser does not work on a new tab that is empty.
- In the top nav bar's "Help" section, type out developer and click the "Developer > Developer Tools" results. Alternatively you can press `Command + Option + I` in your keyboard. You should see a new popup on the right handside of the screen.
- <img width="600" alt="Screenshot 2024-05-23 at 4 11 48 PM" src="https://github.com/Reed-CompBio/protein-weaver/assets/67818840/b2686767-4a46-4bf6-8fd8-c3a27c3d8fc5">
- Type out the following code into the console

```
fetch('http://localhost:3000/api/getAvgDegree', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({"nodeList": ["Q6P2U7","Q6DHB6","Q1LXK0","Q502C6","F1QC03"],"species": "txid7955"}),
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => console.log(data))
.catch((error) => {
    console.error('Error:', error);
});
```

- This is connecting to the backend's port of 3000 and calling out the /getAvgDegree API and specifying that it is a POST request type. Since this is a POST request, we need to provide it with a body. Notice that we provide a JSON object with two keys, "nodeList" and "species". This matches the API call's requirements in the routes.js of /getAvgdegree.
- You should get the following result:
- ![Screenshot 2024-05-24 at 1 01 21 PM](https://github.com/Reed-CompBio/protein-weaver/assets/67818840/79a97f08-39d5-4fec-bd7a-c5f4c5f8cc61)
- This output showcases that we found that the average degree of all these nodes is 10.6.


Below includes a visualization that summarises the key parts of the backend server. Now that you have a better understanding about how API calls are made and how to test them, we can now implement a new API call that will use the neo4j query you made previously.
![ProteinWeaver_Backend](https://github.com/Reed-CompBio/protein-weaver/assets/67818840/40e2d2c4-852b-4520-a75a-ea6d006adde6)

#### Adding new API Call

Now we are ready to implement a new API call. For this project we highly recommend creating a new Neo4j query that you like. We recommend that your query should only return nodes, as this will help the later steps.

1. Create a new file in the service directory.
   - You can duplicate the avg.degree.service.js file and rename it to something that represents your query.
   - Within the file, rename the class name to something that represents your query.
   - Rename the method “getAvgDegree” to something that represents your query.
   - Change the parameters of the method to include what you need for your query. (You may not need any in your parameters if you are hardcoding a query)
   - Place your neo4j query inside of tx.run()
   - You can delete the part where speciesInput and nodeList are paired if you do not have any parameters. If you do have parameters, make sure you pair the parameters properly with the neo4j query.
   - We want to only return the nodes of the query. Add the following code to the bottom of the method's return. You may need to change the variable names to match the res:
   ```
   //return nodes;
   return res.records.map((record) => record.get('n'));
   ```
   - You are now done with setting up your service file for your API call
2. Create a new API call in router.js.
   - You can use the /getAvgDegree API call as reference.
   - Make sure to import your new service file at the top of the router.js
   - Set the API URL to a name that represents your query
   - If your API call will need some parameters, set the correct variables in the request body, just like how getAvgDegree did it with nodeList and species
   - Create a new instance of the service class you made previously like AvgDegreeService with the neo4j driver
   - Call your method in the service class, and making sure if you need the parameters, you order it correctly
   - Finally make sure the res.json function has the correct variable.
3. Test out your API call
   - All API calls in proteinweaver goes under the following url. Simply add your API call after the last backslash: http://localhost:3000/api/
   - Ensure that you are setting the response as a POST response
   - If you require parameters in your API call, make sure to set the body. Refer to the previous example where we tested the API call of /getAvgDegree

If you see that the API response is what you expect, good job!

## Step: 6 Add a New Page

Now that we have linked the backend with the Neo4j database through the API call, we will create a React webpage with a button that lets a user execute our new query. The Protein Weaver Contributing Guide Doc in the GDrive has resources to understand what the frontend does.

### Understanding the frontend

Before we connect our new API call in the backend to the frontend and display the information in a new page, it is important to understand the frontend code. Here is a brief description of the important files in the `/client` directory

#### index.html

The start of how most web browsers will understand our code. It is very simple but this is the original way of making websites. since we are using React.js as a frontend framework, we link HTML with react in `<body>` tag,

```html
<script type="module" src="/src/main.jsx"></script>
```

#### main.jsx

Now we are in the land of Javascript. This file is responsible for routing the users through the various pages in our website. Given a certain file path, we associate it with a component that represents the page.

```js
  {
    path: "/about",
    element: <AboutPage />,
    errorElement: <ErrorPage />,
  },
```

#### Page Example

We wrap all the contents of the page in a Page.jsx file, for example AboutPage.jsx. Here the page comtains a `MainLayout.jsx` component that is contains the footer and nav bar

#### Components

Components are the heart of how React apps are built. They are an important concept to learn and allows you to modularise parts of your website that repeat itself, such as the NavBar, Footer, MainLayout etc. They follow a simple structure of importing all the packages you need, defining and exporting a component as a function, adding other helper functions, and returning the HTML part of your code. `NavBar.jsx` is a simple example of a component and `Query.jsx` is a complex component that includes many state variables, helper functions, and uses other components within.


You are now ready to tackle the next part of your contributing guide, where we will create a new page that incorporates the new API call you previously have made. Take your time to look at videos about frontend development. Here is a general overview of adding a new page and a new API query:
![ProteinWeaver Frontend](https://github.com/Reed-CompBio/protein-weaver/assets/67818840/ef6e911f-83b0-4c70-869c-699e6544d9de)

### Add a Page and Button to Execute Query

1. Navigate to `client/src/pages` and create a new page named `NewPage.jsx`. Examine the other pages in this directory and copy the content from `TestingPage.jsx` into the blank `NewPage.jsx`. Replace `TestingPage()` with the name of the new page you created: `NewPage()`.

2. Navigate to `client/src/main.jsx` and add the `NewPage` component to the main website by importing it and creating a route. Import the component by adding this below the other import statements: `import NewPage from "./pages/NewPage.jsx";`. Copy one of the route snippets and replace the `path` and `element` with `"/newpage"` and `<NewPage />`.

3. Navigate to `client/src/components/` and add a new component by creating a page named `NewQuery.jsx`. This document will be where we add the API query and do other styling. Copy these imports to the top of the page and create the NewQuery component:

```js
import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";

// create component
export default function NewQuery() {}
```

4. Now go back to the first page you created `NewPage.jsx`. Import the NewQuery component with `import NewQuery from "../components/NewQuery.jsx";`. Within the central `<div></div>` add `<NewQuery />` to place the component within the NewPage.

5. Go to the previous Service that you created with your own Neo4j Query from earlier. Modify the `return` statement within the first `try` section of your service to `return network.records.map((record) => record.get('n'));` to extract only the data on the nodes that your query returned.

6. Finally, add a `useEffect` hook that will execute your API query when you load the page. Inside of the set of "{ }" brackets in `NewQuery() { }` copy the following code to execute your query on refresh. This is an example of the getAvgDegree API call. Make sure that you change the `/api/newQuery` to match what the API URL is in the routes.js you previously made and put the correct json object your API call needs in the body.

```js
// create empty object to store query results
const [nodeNames, setNodeNames] = useState([]);

// execute query on page reload
useEffect(() => {
  fetch("/api/getAvgDegree", {
    // change to YOUR API call's URL
    method: "POST", // Change to GET if your call is a get request
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      // Example of json body request. need to match your POST request's parameters
      nodeList: ["Q6P2U7", "Q6DHB6", "Q1LXK0", "Q502C6", "F1QC03"],
      species: "txid7955",
    }),
  })
    .then((res) => res.json())
    .then((data) => {
      const names = data.map((item) => item.properties.name); // extract just names
      setNodeNames(names);
    })
    .catch((error) => {
      console.error("Error fetching network data:", error);
    });
}, []);

// display the node names in the console (right click and inspect element)
console.log(nodeNames);
```

You can check the structure of your query response in the running `server` terminal. Using the object hierarchy displayed there, we extracted just the "name" property in the useEffect hook for displaying. You should now have a blank page at http://localhost:5173/newpage that allows you to see the names of the nodes returned by your Neo4j query in the console when you inspect the page element.

### Add Button to Execute Query

1. Now we will add the ability for users to execute the query on demand rather than when refreshing the page. To do this, first we will modify the useEffect statement and make it a function:

```js
// Function for submitting the query
async function handleNewQuery(e) {
  setNodeNames([]); // reset upon execution
  e.preventDefault(); // prevent default form submission

  // copied exactly from the useEffect statement
  fetch("/api/getAvgDegree", {
    // change to YOUR API call's URL
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      // Example of json body request. need to match your POST request's parameters
      nodeList: ["Q6P2U7", "Q6DHB6", "Q1LXK0", "Q502C6", "F1QC03"],
      species: "txid7955",
    }),
  })
    .then((response) => response.json())
    .then((data) => {
      const names = data.map((item) => item.properties.name);
      setNodeNames(names);
    })
    .catch((error) => {
      console.error("Error:", error);
    });

  // functions must return something, since we executed everything and assigned node names already we just return
  return;
}
```

2. Next we will create a New Query button that executes our new function when clicked. Place this inside of the { } brackets of `NewQuery() { }` after everything else. A React component is like any other function, it must end in a return statement. The return statement holds everything that the user will actually interact with and is where we will style things as well.

```js
return (
  <div>
    <button onClick={handleNewQuery}>New Query</button>
  </div>
);
```

Now we should have a button that will set the node results in the console only after we have pressed it.

3. Now lets display the information to the users without having to inspect the element. Copy the following code below the `<button></button>` inside of the `<div></div>`:

```js
{
  nodeNames.map((name, index) => (
    <p key={index}>
      {index + 1}: {name}
    </p>
  ));
}
```

We are now displaying a list of the node names ordered by their index.

Congratulations, you have now created a new webpage with full connection to the Neo4j database!

### Add New Page Icon to NavBar

Let's finish off by doing some styling and adding a new icon to the NavBar.

1. Navigate to `client/src/components/NavBar.jsx` and copy one of the `<li></li>` snippets and paste it below another. Create a new link to your page by replacing the old link with `<Link to={/newpage}>`.

2. Now rename the icon by typing "New" within the `<div></div>`.

3. Finally navigate to https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/ and choose your favorite icon. I will be using the GiTigerHead icon for mine! Add the relevant import statement to the top of the NavBar page: `import { GiTigerHead } from "react-icons/gi";`. Next replace the icon component in the code that you copied from earlier with the name of the new one. In my case I put `<GiTigerHead />`.

Congratulations, you have now completed the contributing guide!
